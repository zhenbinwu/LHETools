The code produces a set of plots to validate SMS LHE files
Currently supported models are 
- T1tttt

Each SMS model corresponds to a specific executable (e.g. python/readT1ttttLHE.py)
which takes two arguments as input
- name of the LHE file
- name of the output root file

To run the script
- set the shell environment such that ROOT is seen by python, e.g.

export ROOTSYS=/usr/ROOT/root
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ROOTSYS/lib:$PYTHONDIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export PYTHONPATH=$ROOTSYS/lib:$PYTHONPATH
export PATH=${PATH}:${ROOTSYS}/bin

- run the script as in the example

python python/readT1ttttLHE.py myLHEfile.lhe myHistoFile.root
